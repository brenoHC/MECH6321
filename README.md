# MECH6321
Repository containing all code and literature used for MECH 6321 Optimum Design of Mechanical Systems Term Project 

## Objective 
The project focuses on applying Particle swarm algorithms for optimizing 2D truss structures.

## Methodology 
size Optimization is carried out. Code for the FEA-based solver is generic and hence can be extended to any objective function such as Heat Transfer, truss beams, vibrations, etc.   

## Results
A 50% decrease in the weight was achieved and benchmarked with other methods available. Please look at the attached documents for further understanding of the project.
