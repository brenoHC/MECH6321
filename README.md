# MECH6321
Repository containing all code and literature used for MECH 6321 Optimum Design of Mechanical Systems Term Project 

## Objective 
The project focuses on comparing Genetic and Particle swarm algorithms for optimizing 2D compliance.

## Methodology 
Topology Optimization is carried out. Code for the FEA-based solver is generic and hence can be extended to any objective function such as Heat Transfer, truss beams, vibrations, etc.   

## Results
A XXX% decrease in the weight was achieved and benchmarked with other methods available. Please look at the attached documents for further understanding of the project.
